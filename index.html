        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>This is my portoflio page. I always wanted to be a filmmaker and performance artists and I do partake in both. I also want to make things and web development is another medium I get to do that in. I started doing web development in December of 2019 and I have been through 2 coding bootcamps to learn various technologies thus far along with freecodecamp.org which is what I first started using to learn to code. Coding is one of the most challenging things I have ever tried to do, but I love it. This webiste happens to be built using LAMP and served on GitHub Pages. I have another site served on AWS s3. It's called <a href="http://chimoves.co">Chi Moves</a> for a delivery and moving business I started to amke ends meet so it's basically a business card and is a very basic website. </p>
